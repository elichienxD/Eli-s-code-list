# Eli's code list

Below are the repository of codes that I participated. You may find the accompany papers in the corresponding repository. Please also check my [homepage](https://sites.google.com/view/eli-chien/home) for a brief introduction.

- [[KDD 2022] **HyperAid**](https://github.com/elichienxD/HyperAid): Leveraging hyperbolic geometry to improve the performance of tree metric and ultrametric learning methods.
- [[ICLR 2022] **GIANT-XRT**](https://github.com/amzn/pecos/tree/mainline/examples/giant-xrt): Method to extract high quality node features from raw data with self-supervised learning. Achieving rank-1 on ogbn-arxiv, ogbn-products and ogbn-papers100M datasets with huge improvement.
- [[ICLR 2022] **AllSet**](https://github.com/jianhao2016/AllSet): A multiset function framework for hypergraph neural networks. We also collected and curated many benchmark datasets for hypergraph nerual networks.
- [[ICDM 2021 regular] **Poincare linear classification**](https://github.com/thupchnsky/PoincareLinearClassification): Linear classification algorithms in Poincare ball (hyperbolic space) with theoretical guarantees. Our code includes perceptron and SVM.
- [[ICLR 2021] **GPRGNN**](https://sites.google.com/view/eli-chien/home): A GNN provably not only works for heterophilic datasets, but also prevents over-smoothing problem. Furthermore, GPRGNN has the benefit on interpretability.
